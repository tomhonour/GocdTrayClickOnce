# GocdTrayClickOnce

[GocdTray](https://github.com/matroberts/GocdTray) is a Microsoft Windows System Tray Application for monitoring [Go.cd](https://www.gocd.org/).

This project is a [ClickOnce](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ClickOnce) installation of GocdTray.

To install GocdTray download and run [setup.exe](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/matroberts/GocdTrayClickOnce/master/setup.exe).

Because I don't have a code signing certificate you will be presented with a scary warning from windows defender.

![Windows Defender](Images/windows-defender.png?raw=true "Windows Defender")

Click on the "More" link, then the "Run" button.

You will now be presented with another slightly less scary warning "Application Install Security Warning"

![Application Install](Images/application-install.png?raw=true "Application Install")

Click on "Install".  The application will install and should start, though windows defender may bug you again.
